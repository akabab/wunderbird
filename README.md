# Wunder Bird

[>> TRY IT <<](http://ycribier:8000)

It's a remake of flappy bird, improved to be multiplayer online through a web page and directly influenced by the sensed data from the external environment.  

This were orignaly made on April 15' during [Wearhacks](http://www.wearhacks.com/) Hackathon in [42 School](http://www.42.fr/), Paris. This project was then selected alongside other 4 teams and finally won the [Wunderbar](https://www.relayr.io/products-services/wunderbar/) prize.

Wunderbar sensors recover real environement datas such as temperature, noise, humidy.. which ones represents then the "Wunder Bird" game design!

###Real VS Virtual:
- color -> background color  
- humidity -> water height
- temperature -> vertical spacing of the tubes (hotter is harder)
- sound -> lower ceiling then stroboscopic effect (very loud)
- accelerometer y axis -> pipes vertical position (random if accelerometer rests < 1% variations)
- proximity -> a finger shows up in front of the game, muahaha!
