# Wunder Bird

[>> TRY IT <<](http://ycribier:8000)

It's a remake of flappy bird, improved to be multiplayer online through a web page and directly influenced by the sensed data from the external environment.  

This were orignaly made during Wearhacks Hackathon in 42 School, Paris. This project was then selected alongside other 4 teams and finally won the wunderbar prize.

Wunder bar sensors recover real environement datas such as temperature, noise, humidy.. which ones represents then the "Wunder Bird" game design!

###Real VS Virtual:
- color -> background color  
- humidity -> water height
- temperature -> vertical spacing of the tubes (hotter is harder)
- sound -> lower ceiling then stroboscopic effect (very loud)
- accelerometer y axis -> pipes vertical position (random if accelerometer rests < 1% variations)
- proximity -> a finger shows up in front of the game, muahaha!
